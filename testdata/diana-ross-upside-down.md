# Diana Ross - Upside Down

```
Album Diana (1980). Song written by Nile Rodgers and Bernard Edwards (Chic).

You can dress up the Gm chords by making them Gm7, the C chords by making them C7 
and the F chords by making them F6 or F7, but the root chords should be correct.

Instinctively you give to me the love that I need

Respectfully I say to thee, I'm aware that you're cheating
     Bbm7
When no one makes me feel like you do

I know you got charm and appeal, you always play the field
    Bbm7
I'm crazy to think you are mine

As long as the sun continues to shine
          Bbm7
There's a place in my heart for you, that's the bottom line
