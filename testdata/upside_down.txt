[Intro]
Gm C F Gm  Bb Bdim C  F Gm

[Verse 1]
        Gm                 C
I said, upside down you're turning me
       F             Gm
You're giving love instinctively
Bb              Bdim   C          F Gm
Round and round you're turning me

[Chorus]
Gm     C    F         Gm
Upside down, boy, you turn me
Bb Bdim C      F          Gm
Inside  out and round and round
Gm     C    F         Gm
Upside down, boy, you turn me
Bb Bdim C      F          Gm    Gm7 Abm7 Am7
Inside  out and round and round

(loop and fade)
