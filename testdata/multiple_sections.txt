[Verse 1]
    G         C
The morning sun is rising
    D         G
A brand new day begins

[Chorus]
C      G
Oh-oh, sing along
D      G
With me today

[Verse 2]
    G         C
The evening stars are shining
    D         G
As night time softly falls

[Bridge]
Am    Em
Hold on tight
C     D
Everything's alright
